# Chatbot-for-College-Admission
The aim of this project was to develop conversational dialogue agent that can
converse with human with the underlying emotions of the speakers. In particular, I focused on building a counselling Chatbot for college admission.
The data is collected from the online sources, intents have been defined, appropriate dialogue templates have been designed for creating dialogues, and
a deep learning based natural language generation system has been implemented.
